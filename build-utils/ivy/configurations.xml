	<!--
	Summary of Configs
	The artifacts from this project go in master.
	When compiling the main source, the compile and provided libraries will be used.
	When this module is used as a dependency, the master, the runtime and compile libraries will be used (but not the provided libraries).
	When compiling and running tests, the master, test, runtime, compile and provided libraries will be used.

	Adding a dependency without specifying what config it will be used in will add it to the compile config and use the dependency's default config.
